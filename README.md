<em> Music Sharing App Interface </em>

Initially a 2 person team studying blockchain development at George Brown College, Toronto, ON. Development now carried
 on solely by &copy; Temple Okosun. 
 <br><br>
As part of our FullStack Development Course, we are challenged to create a music sharing web application and 
over the period of the course, we will be iteratively improving the application.
<br><br>
I have utilized a combination of HTML5, CSS3, BootStrap4 and JavaScript to achieve the project objectives and hosted 
the app on Azure platform using Github as code repository and versioning.
